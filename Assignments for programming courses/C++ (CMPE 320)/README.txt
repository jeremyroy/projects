These are my assignments for my introduction to object oriented programming course (Winter 2015).
The language used was Java.
I have absolutely no idea where assignment 4 is...  ah well.

If you are currently taking this course and the assignments are the same, please do not
copy my code.  The goal of me posting these here are to demonstrate my programming ability,
not to give people answers to coursework.
