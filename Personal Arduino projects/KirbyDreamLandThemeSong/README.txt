This program plays the Kirby Dreamland song in a loop to a piezo speaker connected
to pin 2 of an Arduino micro-controller.  It's a great way of impressing friends.

WARNING: 
	After running this program, the Kirby Dreamland theme song will be stuck
	in your head for approximately 1.352 weeks.  Users beware.
